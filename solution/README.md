# Documentation of the solution

## Memo to be removed
See the [root README.md](../README.md) for instructions on how to create/clone
your own solution in this directory. The section is called "Your solution".

## Author
Your name

There are two possible approaches to your documentation:
1. either you make a copy of the rest of this template for each checkpoint,
  and append new documentation (for every step/checkpoint) to the end of
  this file
2. or you can use this document as a "road map" and refer to all of the
  other documents from here

You can remove **irrelevant parts** of your documentation for the
clarity.

## Checkpoint X (tag `Chk X`)
Briefly describe the objectives of the checkpoint.

### Command line arguments
List all the arguments here, with default values.

Please indicate your favorite set of parameters (or the set with which it is best to try).

### Config file
Describe all config file data, including semantics (except the obvious),
allowed, and default values.

Version your configuration files (multiple versions - it should be possible to switch
between them simply by a command-line argument). I refuse to edit a configuration
file from scratch so I can test your program.

### Algorithm
Any details of the algorithms worth mentioning should go here.

List the features of your solution that you are proud of.

### Use of AI
Document how an AI assistant helped you or declare that you haven't used AI.
