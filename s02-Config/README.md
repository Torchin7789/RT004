# Step02 - Command line program
* The simple command-line project is already available - see the
  [src directory](../src). It uses C# 10.0 and `.NET 6.0`.
* Copy the pilot project in your directory [/solution](../solution).
  Detailed instructions are in the section "Your solution" of
  the [global README.md](../README.md).
* Setup a simple command-line parameter and config-file parsing system
  – any simple text based (or XML-based) format is possible.
* Print the input argument (`Console.WriteLine()`) to see if it works.
* Some simple logging/debug system could be useful but you can postpone it...
