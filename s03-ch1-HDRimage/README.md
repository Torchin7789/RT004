# Step03 - Raster image output
* Your program should create an HDR raster image with the given
  resolution and write it to a disk file – PFM and Radiance HDR
  formats are available in the pilot project [/src/rt004](../src/rt004)
* Implement any "non-trivial" image content (e.g. defined by a formula)
  – please test your command-line/config parameters, try to modify
  the image resolution and content
* Any images based on simple patterns, goniometry, etc. will suffice

# Checkpoint 1
Send me an URL of your repository, I'll check it (access, compile,
run, HDR image). I'll try to modify your config file as well...
