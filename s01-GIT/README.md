# Step01 - GIT repository setup
* Create **your own private GIT repository** – [GitLab](https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/) and
  [GitHub](https://github.com/) are two recommended platforms.
* Link the original (this) repository as **`remote upstream`** - you can use the command
  `git remote add upstream https://github.com/pepcape/RT004.git`
* Import data from the `upstream`, you will get the complete original repo,
  you will be able to update it (`git pull upstream main`) and keep it
  in sinc with `RT004`. However, you should work in the `solution` directory only.
* Setup your own **Visual Studio project** – you can copy it from the
  [RT004/src/rt004](https://github.com/pepcape/RT004/tree/main/src/rt004).
  The recommended location for your solution is the [solution](../solution) directory.
* Write your initial documentation page using the
  [Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax),
  [Another MarkDown page](https://www.markdownguide.org/),
  [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* Grant me **permissions** ("reporter", "collaborator") to your repository –
  <https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/pelikan>, <https://github.com/pepcape>
* Although you will grant me access (and I will be notified by email),
  you will need to **email me at least initially**! I need to associate
  your name with your GIT account and email address.
